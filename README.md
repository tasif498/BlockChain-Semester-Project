# BlockChain-Semester-Project 

## Project Description

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Sepolia Chain on the Ethereum testnet. It enables users to sign in using their MetaMask wallets and create campaigns for crowdfunding. Other users can then contribute funds to these campaigns using their MetaMask account balance. The platform leverages technologies such as Node.js, React, Express, Ether.js, and Thirdweb with Hardhat for deployment.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a transparent and secure crowdfunding solution, where users can create campaigns and raise funds for their projects or causes. By utilizing blockchain technology, the platform ensures the integrity of transactions and eliminates the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts govern the campaign logic, allowing for automated and trustless fundraising.

The project offers a user-friendly interface powered by React, enabling seamless interaction with the crowdfunding platform. Users can easily create campaigns by providing essential details such as title, description, and funding goal. The campaigns are publicly visible, allowing other users to explore and contribute funds to projects they support. Campaign owners can monitor the progress of their campaigns and withdraw funds once the funding goal is achieved.

Through the integration of MetaMask wallets, users can securely sign in to their Ethereum accounts and manage their funds for crowdfunding purposes. MetaMask provides a convenient way to interact with decentralized applications, ensuring that transactions are signed and executed securely.

By leveraging the Sepolia Chain on the Ethereum testnet, the project harnesses the power of blockchain technology for crowdfunding purposes. Sepolia Chain serves as a testing environment, allowing developers to experiment and deploy smart contracts without incurring costs on the main Ethereum network.
